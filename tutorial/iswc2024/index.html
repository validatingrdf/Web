        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>Knowledge Graphs are increasingly being employed to improve data interoperability, search, and
          recommendation, alongside
          fostering the adoption of semantic web technologies. The quality of data within these graphs is pivotal, often
          validated
          against expected data models or shapes to enhance accuracy. Various technologies implement knowledge graphs;
          RDF-based
          triplestores are canonical in the Semantic Web, while in the graph databases context, Property Graphs are also
          considered for Knowledge Graphs. Wikidata, a popular Knowledge Graph, offers RDF through its SPARQL query
          service, but
          its data model aligns closely with Property Graphs using qualifiers and references, and the recent proposal of
          RDF-Star
          can bridge the gap between RDF and Property Graphs.</p>
        <p>Shape Expressions (ShEx) and Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) were proposed for RDF validation while in the
          case of
          Property Graphs, PGSchema was proposed, as well as other proposals like PShEx or ProGS. Wikidata adopted
          Entity Schemas,
          which are based on ShEx as well as its own property constraint system, and there is a proposal called WShEx.
        </p>
        <p>This tutorial explores different types of Knowledge Graphs and approaches for their validation. We will also
          review practical
          applications like inferring shapes from existing data and creating conforming subsets of Knowledge Graphs.</p>

      <section id="overview">
        <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
        <!--       <p>RDF data can be considered the <em>llingua franca</em> of the semantic web.
          It possess a number of indisputable benefits like flexibility, easy integration and openness.
          It forms a core layer for knowledge representation in the semantic web stack and
          the availability of RDF data stores and SPARQL makes it a right choice for practical applications.
          Although RDF, and graph stores in general, don't demand an initial schema definition like SQL, and operates in
          a more flexible way, practical applications impose further demands.
          In that sense ShEx and SHACL work with the open spirit of RDF (natively schema-less), while giving developers
          and data architects a tool to impose and validate some specific constraints.
          The need to increase the quality of RDF data has made that the adoption of ShEx and SHACL in Semantic Web
          projects has been increasing and nowadays they are an important part of the semantic web tooling.
        </p>

        <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/">SHACL</a> was proposed by the <a
            href="https://www.w3.org/2014/data-shapes/">Data Shapes Working Group</a>
          and accepted as a W3C Recommendation in July 2017 while <a href="http://shex.io/">ShEx</a>
          has been proposed by the W3C ShEx community group.
        </p>

        <p>Since their appearance, both ShEx and SHACL have been increasingly adopted by semantic web data
          practitioners.
          SHACL has been adopted in enterprise data management scenarios as well as government.
          On the other hand ShEx has also been adopted in scenarios like
          the <a href="https://github.com/geneontology/go-shapes">Gene Ontology</a> or
          <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a>
        </p>

        <p>Like the popular <a
            href="SPARQL by example">http://www.cambridgesemantics.com/semantic-university/sparql-by-example</a>
          tutorial,
          this tutorial is intended to provide step-by-step instructions with examples.
          Participants will be able to play with validation tools using web-based interfaces like <a
            href="http://rdfshape.weso.es">RDFShape</a>,
          <a href="http://wikishape.weso.es">WikiShape</a> or
          <a href="https://rawgit.com/shexSpec/shex.js/master/doc/shex-simple.html">ShEx Simple online validator</a>} to
          validate their RDF data.

      <section id="topics">
        <h3>Topics</h3>
        <p>We are planning for a half-day tutorial with the following topics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Introduction to Knowledge graphs</li>
          <li>Technologies for Knowledge Graphs: RDF, Property Graphs, Wikidata and Wikibase, RDF-Star (RDF 1.2)</li>
          <li>Validating RDF: ShEx, SHACL, Comparison between ShEx and SHACL</li>
          <li>Validating Property Graphs: PGSchema, GQL, PShEx, ProGS</li>
          <li>Validating Wikibase and Wikidata graphs: Entity Schemas, Wikidata Property Constraints, WShEx</li>
          <li>Proposal for extending ShEx and SHACL for RDF-Star</li>
          <li>Applications: Inferring shapes from data, Knowledge Graphs Subsets, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We plan to devote the first slot to the first 3 items (knowledge graphs as well as Validating RDF
          technologies, ShEx and SHACL) which are more introductory,
          and the second slot for the rest of the items, which are more specialised.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="goals">
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Attendees will understand the different types of technologies to implement Knowledge Graphs</li>
          <li>Users will understand the differences between the data models of RDF, Property graphs, Wikibase and
            RDF-Star.</li>
          <li>Participants will understand use cases for defining shapes and validating Knowledge Graphs.</li>
          <li>Participants will be able to create their own RDF data shapes or Schemas and validate instance data
            against them using ShEx and SHACL.</li>
          <li>They will see how RDF validation works in ShEx and SHACL.</li>
          <li>Hands-on experience will leave users comfortable using existing tools to solve practical needs in
            communicating
            schemas and verifying instance data conformance.</li>
          <li>Users will be able to assess and compare the differences between ShEx, SHACL and other validation
            approachs for property graphs and Wikibase.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h3 id="audience">Tutorial type and intended audience</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Target audience: Anyone interested in Knolwedge Graphs and data quality.</li>
        <li>Tutorial type: We consider that this is a introductory/specialised tutorial as it can serve as an
          introduction to
          people that are not aware of the technologies, but we can also offer specialised knowledge about validating
          property
          graphs in the second slot.</li>
        <li>Prior knowledge: Some rudimentary knowledge of RDF and Turtle is expected, although a short introduction to
          the
          RDF data model will be done.</li>
        <li>Tutorial type: We propose a half day tutorial, although we could extend the length if necessary.</li>
        <li>Materials: We will create a github repository containing the running examples that can be executed online
          using
          the following tools: <a href="http://rdfshape.weso.es/">RDFShape</a>,
          <a href="http://rdfshape.weso.es/">Wikishape</a>,
          <a href="https://rawgit.com/shexSpec/shex.js/master/doc/shex-simple.html">ShEx Simple Online Tool</a>,
          <a href="http://shacl.org/playground/">SHACL playground</a>
          and Jupyter Labs running Python-based libraries.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Anyone interested in Semantic Web technologies and tools is expected to attend this tutorial.
        Some rudimentary knowledge of RDF and Turtle is expected, although a short introduction to the RDF data model
        will be done.
