        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>Since Google announced the internal use of Knowledge Graphs to improve search and organize information, their
          use and
          application has increased impressively.
        <p>Various technologies have been proposed to implement Knowledge Graphs:
          RDF-based triplestores are canonical in the Semantic Web, while in the graph databases context Labeled
          Property Graphs like Neo4J
          are also considered as another technology for Knowledge Graphs.
          <a href="https://www.wikidata.org">Wikidata</a>, a popular Knowledge Graph, offers RDF through its SPARQL
          query service, but its data model aligns
          closely with
          Property Graphs using qualifiers and references.
          The proposal of RDF-Star which is expected to become <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf12-concepts/">RDF
            1.2</a> can bridge the gap between RDF and
          Property Graphs by allowing statements about statements.
        </p>
        <p>The quality of data within these graphs is pivotal, often validated against expected data models or shapes to
          enhance
          accuracy.
          We will present some approaches that have been developed to describe and validate RDF like Shape Expressions
          (<a href="http://shex.io/">ShEx</a>) or
          Shapes Constraint Language (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/">SHACL</a>).
          We will briefly describe them and show some differences.</p>
        <p>In the case of Property Graphs, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10962">PGSchema</a> was proposed, as well
          as other proposals like <a href="https://labra.weso.es/publication/2024_shex_extensions/">PShEx</a> or ProGS,
          and
          more recently
          <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/76120.html">GQL</a> offers a way to define typed graphs.
        </p>
        <p>Wikidata adopted Entity Schemas, which are based on ShEx as well as its own property constraint system, and
          there is a
          proposal called <a href="https://www.weso.es/WShEx/">WShEx</a>.</p>

        <p>This tutorial will explore different types of Knowledge Graphs and approaches for their validation. We will
          also
          review practical
          applications like inferring shapes from existing data and creating conforming subsets of Knowledge Graphs.</p>

        <p>We plan to devote the first slot to the first 3 items (knowledge graphs as well as Validating RDF
          technologies, ShEx and SHACL) which are more introductory,
          and the second slot for the rest of the items, which are more specialised.

      <h3 id="audience">Tutorial type and intended audience</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Target audience: Anyone interested in Knolwedge Graphs and data quality.</li>
        <li>Tutorial type: We consider that this is a introductory/specialised tutorial as it can serve as an
          introduction to
          people that are not aware of the technologies, but we can also offer specialised knowledge about validating
          property
          graphs in the second slot.</li>
        <li>Prior knowledge: Some rudimentary knowledge of RDF and Turtle is expected, although a short introduction to
          the
          RDF data model will be done.</li>
        <li>Tutorial type: Half day tutorial (14h to 17:40h, 11th November 2024).</li>
        <li>Materials: We will create a github repository containing the running examples that can be executed online
          using
          the following tools:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://rdfshape.weso.es/">RDFShape</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://rdfshape.weso.es/">Wikishape</a></li>

            Shape Expressions and SHACL.
            He implemented the SHACL and ShEx library <a href="http://www.weso.es/shaclex/">SHaclEX</a> in Scala,
            maintains the online RDF validator services <a href="http://rdfshape.weso.es/">RDFShape</a>
            and <a href="http://wikishape.weso.es/">WikiShape</a>, and is now implementing the <a
              href="https://rudof-project.github.io/">rudof</a> library in Rust which can also be used to validate RDF
